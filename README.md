# QSel
 Qsel is my First Created App for use.
This is my first android project i created and used for my preparation of JEE and CET. This provides easy solving,checking and logging mechanisms for all quest solved.
It provides floating window while solving that is used to mark ans, mark doubtful quest, and also provides inbuilt timer.
